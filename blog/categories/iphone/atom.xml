<p>How close was I?</p>

<p>I was pretty close, the only thing I got wrong (and frankly surprised me!) was the device size. I thought the physical device will be the same size as the 4S, just with a larger screen. Instead, the iPhone 5 is 4.87" tall, compared to 4.5" for the 4S. So roughly 8% taller.</p>

<p>The width is identical - 2.31".</p>

<p>The depth, amazingly, is thinner - the new iPhone is 0.30", compared to the 4S which was 0.37". 18% thinner. It's also lighter at 3.95oz, vs 4.9oz..which comes out to 19% lighter.</p>

<p>To quote Tim Cook...That is truly amazing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2012/">Watch the entire Apple Event</a> announcing the iPhone 5 and the slew of other new products and services announced yesterday, including the new Apple Maps, a new iPod Nano, and some pretty impressive stats as to how Apple is doing. Also check out <a href="http://current.com/s/management.htm">my boss</a> Al Gore sitting in the audience in the front row. He'll be hard to miss - they pan to him <em>every</em> single time they showed the audience (I guess the camera man was impressed).</p>

<p>Finally...is Steve Job's presence still felt during these presentations? Without a doubt. Even though each apple exec's style is his own - Job's presentation style is an unspoken presence in every Apple Event.</p>
