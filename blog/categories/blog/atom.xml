    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just moved my blog from wordpress.com to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. Octopress runs atop <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> to generate static files and can deploy to pretty much any hosting provider - but has special tools for hosting on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> - where this blog is now hosted. First I looked at Jekyll on its own, but seems like it required too much manual configuration - whereas Octopress makes all the choices for you. You just need to make changes.</p>

<p>Blog posts are created by editing a text file locally using Textmate 1 in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">markdown</a>, generating the blog and deploying. The blog's filename implies the posting date, for example this posts file name is</p>

<pre><code>sources/_posts/2012-09-07-from-wordpress-to-octopress.markdown
</code></pre>

<p>and you also include what they call a YAML UpfrontMatter to the top of every post to include additional metadata. For example for this post:</p>

<h2>``` yaml</h2>

<p>layout: posta
title: "From wordpress to octopress"
date: 2012-09-07 23:10
comments: true</p>

<h2>categories: </h2>

<p>```</p>

<p>So far I'm really happy with it. If you'd like to give it a whirl yourself, All the info you need is at <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. It's got a very vibrant community, which is always a good thing.</p>
