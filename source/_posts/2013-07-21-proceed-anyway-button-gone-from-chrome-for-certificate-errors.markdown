"This site's security certificate is not trusted"!
==================================================

Apparently Chrome did away with the "Proceed Anyway" button, and now it just gives you the option for "Back to Safety". It took a bit of googling but I discovered that if you type the letters for the word "proceed", then it will let you view the site anyway.

As far as I can tell, there is no other way - no advanced preferences or anything similar.
