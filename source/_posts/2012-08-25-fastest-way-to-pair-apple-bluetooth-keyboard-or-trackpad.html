If you're like me and constantly use the same keyboard+trackpad on 4 different OSX computers..you may appreciate this tip. Fastest way to pair to a new computer (<strong>even if its already paired with a different computer)</strong>:
<ol>
	<li>Put the device in pairing mode FIRST*</li>
	<li>Now go to System Preferences --&gt; Trackpad --&gt; Set up bluetooth trackpad</li>
</ol>
You'll notice the device is recognized immediately.

Of course replace #2 with Keyboard if you're pairing a keyboard.

*To put the device in pairing mode:
<ol>
	<li>Long press on the power button on the side of the device until the device powers down (light goes on, then goes off)</li>
	<li>2nd long press on the power button, until the device powers up and goes into pairing mode (light goes on, then starts blinking)</li>
	<li>Don't let go of the button until the laptop shows that the device is connected</li>
</ol>
