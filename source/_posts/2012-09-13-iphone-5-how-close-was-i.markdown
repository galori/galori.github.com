Follw up to last week's post: [Summary of Apple Rumors and Predictions Which I Believe to Be True]({%post_url 2012-09-08-summary-of-apple-rumors-and-predictions-which-i-believe-to-be-true%})...

How close was I?

I was pretty close, the only thing I got wrong (and frankly surprised me!) was the device size. I thought the physical device will be the same size as the 4S, just with a larger screen. Instead, the iPhone 5 is 4.87" tall, compared to 4.5" for the 4S. So roughly 8% taller. 

The width is identical - 2.31".

The depth, amazingly, is thinner - the new iPhone is 0.30", compared to the 4S which was 0.37". 18% thinner. It's also lighter at 3.95oz, vs 4.9oz..which comes out to 19% lighter.

To quote Tim Cook...That is truly amazing.

[Watch the entire Apple Event](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2012/) announcing the iPhone 5 and the slew of other new products and services announced yesterday, including the new Apple Maps, a new iPod Nano, and some pretty impressive stats as to how Apple is doing. Also check out [my boss](http://current.com/s/management.htm) Al Gore sitting in the audience in the front row. He'll be hard to miss - they pan to him _every_ single time they showed the audience (I guess the camera man was impressed).

Finally...is Steve Job's presence still felt during these presentations? Without a doubt. Even though each apple exec's style is his own - Job's presentation style is an unspoken presence in every Apple Event.
