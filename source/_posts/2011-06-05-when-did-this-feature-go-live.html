It can be very useful to be able to answer this question accurately.

To do this, add code to your deploy script that tags every production deploy with git. Example:

[sourcecode]
  timestamp = Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d/at/%H.%M')
  tag_name = &quot;deploy/#{timestamp}&quot;
  `git tag #{tag_name}; git push origin #{tag_name}`
[/sourcecode]

Now, if the question ever comes up when a particular feature went live, you can determine this down to the minute. Find a commit that was part of this feature. For example, a new header design:

[sourcecode]
   git log --grep=&quot;header&quot;
[/sourcecode]

Now you can use the <strong> --contains</strong> switch to find the earliest tag that contained this particular commit: 

[sourcecode]
   git tag --contains &lt;SHA&gt;
[/sourcecode]
