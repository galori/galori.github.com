Git responses are usually very straightforward and to the point, but today I got git to say <strong>"Yeah!"</strong> by telling it to merge something it just merged. To get your git to be a little silly too:

Immediately after doing a merge, look at that last merge commit

[sourcecode]
$ git log -n1 

commit 76c4ac19c545fdc9d20c43beb358c47c0d84185a
&lt;strong&gt;Merge: 2619f49 0f71f1f&lt;/strong&gt;

[master] Merge branch 'release'
[/sourcecode]

Then...tell git to merge the same two SHA's again

[sourcecode]
$ git merge 2619f49 0f71f1f
Already up-to-date. Yeeah!
[/sourcecode]

This is using git v1.7.5.4 command line, on OSX.
