Productivity tip: timmorrow.com has a little "how to" to create a Ctrl-A to archive shortcut for Outlook for Mac 2011. If you're used to the one click "Archive" button from Gmail but are stuck using Outlook for work - you'll love this.

One note: He leaves out the important detail that you need to use the Apple Script Editor to edit and save his script, not just any text editor. Otherwise, its flawless, and will improve your productivity by 250%, studies show.

**Update #1 (9/2013)**: After using this for a few weeks (1) its fantastic but (2) you lose the Ctrl-Z to undo that you get with message deletion. If anyone knows a way around this, let me know.

**Update #2 (4/15/2014)**: Since upgrading to a new Retina MBPro with Mavericks - I am trying out Apple Mail, Apple Calendar and Apple Contacts with our Corprate Exchange server. It works surprisingly well. Even to the point of showing availability information for meeting attendees. I mapped Cmd-E to the built in Archive feature.
