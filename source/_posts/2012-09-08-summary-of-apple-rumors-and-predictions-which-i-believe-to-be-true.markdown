For all those that don't obsessively follow the Apple news and rumor sites, I'll summarize it for you. I'm hoping to keep this list updated.

<!-- more -->

iPhone
------

  * Apple will be announcing the iPhone 5 on September 12th ([See invitation sent to the press](/images/posts/iphone-5-invite.jpeg))
  * It will be available in stores on September 21st ([based on Verizon employee's blackout schedule](http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/21/iphone-5-launch-date/))
  * It will have a new, smaller dock connector ([source](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/23/us-apple-connector-idUSBRE86M07320120723))
  * The device size will be identical to the iPhone 4, but the screen will be slightly taller, making it a 16x9 aspect ratio
  * It will support the faster LTE cellphone networks
  * Apple is following the [Intel tick/tock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Tick-Tock) release pattern of alternating major version updgrades and then incremental improvements: iPhone 3 / iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 / iPhone 4s, iPhone 5. Expect an iPhone 5s next year.

iPad
----

  * Apple will announce a new, smaller (7") iPad in October [source](http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/08/23/iphone-5-and-ipad-mini-events/)
  * It will be cheaper than the current iPads. 
  
iOS 6
-----

  * Developers already have it - public release before the end of the year. 
  * It replaces Google Maps with a new Apple Maps app. (Apple bought several mapping startups over the last few years for this)
  * It will have Facebook integration
  * Facetime over the cell network! (AT&T will be limiting this to customers with shared data plans)
  * New "Passbook" app for paperless flight tickets, concert and movie tickets, etc., but [no NFC](http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/08/28/nfc-on-the-new-iphone/). 
  
Mac OSX
-------

  * Apple will be releasing a new version every year going forward, also following the tick/tock pattern. Major new version every other year, and incremental upgrades in between: Leopard / Snow Leopard, Lion / Mountain Lion. Expect a new cat next year.
  
Retina Display
--------------

  * I expect _all_ Apple products to eventually have [retina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_display) display - but this may take a few years.

If you'd like to stay up-to-date, here are a few blogs I recommend which do a good job of filtering out the noise and making smart and informed predictions:

Many sites publish Apple rumors, but a lot of them trade accuracy for page views and will publish [unconfirmed](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/flush-with-cash-will-apple-go-shopping/) or sometimes even [silly rumors](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/04/15/what-apple-ceo-tim-cooks-visit-to-valve-means/).
