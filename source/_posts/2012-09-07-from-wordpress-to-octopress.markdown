Just moved my blog from wordpress.com to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). Octopress runs atop [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static files and can deploy to pretty much any hosting provider - but has special tools for hosting on [github pages](http://pages.github.com/) - where this blog is now hosted.

Blog posts are created by editing a text file locally in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), generating the blog and deploying. 

Pretty cool!
