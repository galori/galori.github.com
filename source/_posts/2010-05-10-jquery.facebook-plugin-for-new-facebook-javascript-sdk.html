Facebook announced a slew of new SDKs during <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/">f8</a> a couple weeks ago, including a new <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/">javascript SDK</a>. The new SDK provides access to the new Open Graph API and facebook authentication (now OAUTH).

This plugin is a lightweight wrapper that provides a less verbose and more jQuery-like interface to it, plus a few basic utilities.  The plan is to grow this in future versions to provide more features but it already makes things more fun to use.

Basic usage example:

[sourcecode language="jscript"]
$.facebook.init('123456789'); //your facebook app ID

$.facebook.ready(function(){
  $.facebook.api('/zuck',function(response){
    console.log(response.name + &quot; : &quot; + response.gender);
  });
});
[/sourcecode] 

This results in the following (any public profile information is accessible without a logged in user).

[sourcecode language="jscript"]
Mark Zuckerberg : male
[/sourcecode] 

Additionally, a page level attribute is added:

[sourcecode language="jscript"]
$('body').data('facebook-ready');
[/sourcecode]
