If you're like me you might have tens (or hundreds?) of "draft branches" from various spikes, experiments and aborted attempts at features. 

`git find` helps you find which branch has some code you're looking for.  Usage:

```bash
$ git find

Search through all local branches for a string in the diff. Usage:

git-find <string>
git-find <string> <base_branch>

$ git find vnc

base branch: master

DAT-20177_debug_flaky_specs
DAT-20177_flaky_drafts
```
