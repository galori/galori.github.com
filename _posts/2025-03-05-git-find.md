If you're like me you might have tens (or hundreds?) of "draft branches" from various spikes, experiments and aborted attempts at features. 

`git find` helps you find which branch has some code you're looking for.  Usage:

<pre class="language-bash code-block-copyable">
<code>$ git find

Search through all local branches for a string in the diff. Usage:

git-find &lt;string&gt;
git-find &lt;string&gt; &lt;base_branch&gt;

$ git find vnc

base branch: master

DAT-20177_debug_flaky_specs
DAT-20177_flaky_drafts
</code>
</pre>
