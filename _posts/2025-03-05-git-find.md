If you're like me you might have tens (or hundreds?) of "draft branches" from various spikes, experiments and aborted attempts at features. 

`git find` searches through your local branches to find a branch that has the code you're looking for in it's diff.  Usage:

<pre class="">
<code>$ git find

Search through all local branches for a string in the diff. Usage:

git-find &lt;string&gt;
git-find &lt;string&gt; &lt;base_branch&gt;

$ git find vnc

base branch: master

DAT-20177_flaky_drafts</code></pre>

To set this up, place this script somewhere in your path. Git will automatically translate `git find` to `git-find`:

`git-find`:

<pre class="language-bash code-block-copyable "><code>#! /bin/bash

# set the default base branch
DEFAULT_BASE_BRANCH="master"

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo -e "\nSearch through all local branches for a string in the diff. Usage:\n"
  echo -e "git-find [string]"
  echo -e "git-find [string] [base_branch]\n"
  exit 1
fi

base_branch="${2:-$DEFAULT_BASE_BRANCH}"

# Check if the base branch exists
if ! git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$base_branch"; then
  echo "Base branch '$base_branch' does not exist."
  exit 1
fi

echo "base branch: $base_branch"

for branch in $(git branch --format='%(refname:short)'); do
  diff_output=$(git diff "$(git merge-base "$branch" "$base_branch")" "$branch" | grep "$1")
  if [ -n "$diff_output" ]; then
    echo "$branch"
  fi
done</code></pre>
