I did a thing!

My wife, son & I like listening to posts from subreddits like r/amitheasshole and r/amiwwrong while we're in the car, and then discussing and rendering our own judgement. However, the text-to-speech on the reddit app is pretty bad, so I built an app that does it better. 

It works kind of like a Spotify for reddit advice posts - it reads out the post and the top comments.
