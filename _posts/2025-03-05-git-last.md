`cd -` and `git checkout -` both switch back to the previous folder and branch you were on, respectively.

I use this frequently but it doesn't work so well with `git` because more often than not I switched to `main` in between the two branches. `git last` was made to solve this:

# `git last`

Displays the last 10 branches you were on, and allows you to switch to one of them. Usage:

```bash
[~/workspace/aitah-player]─[±] main {29} ✓                                                                                                                                          [Wed Mar 05 - 16:16]

Below is the script. Place it anywhere in your path, and `git` will be smart enough to translate `git last` to `git-last`:

`git-last`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the current branch name
current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

# Generate the list of branches excluding the current one and non-existent branches
branches=$(git reflog --date=iso | grep checkout | awk '/checkout: moving from/ {print $8}' | grep -v '^[0-9a-f]\{40\}$' | grep -v "$current_branch" | awk '!seen[$0]++' | while read branch; do
    if git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/$branch; then
        echo $branch
    fi
done | head -n 20)

# Print the branches with line numbers
echo "$branches" | nl -n ln

# Ask the user to select a branch
read -p "Enter the number of the branch you want to checkout (or press Enter to skip): " branch_number

# Check if branch_number is not empty
if [ -n "$branch_number" ]; then
    # Get the name of the selected branch
    branch_name=$(echo "$branches" | sed "${branch_number}q;d")

    # Check if the branch name is not empty
    if [ -n "$branch_name" ]; then
        # Checkout the selected branch
        git checkout "$branch_name"
    else
        echo "Invalid branch number. Skipping checkout."
    fi
else
    echo "No branch number entered. Skipping checkout."
fi
```
